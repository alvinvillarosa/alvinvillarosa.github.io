    <h1>Alvin Villarosa - Professional Work</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Alvin, and I am an aspiring physician scientist majoring in Science Management with a concentration in neuroscience. 
        Through my major and career goals, I hope to further advance my knowledge and experience in healthcare, medicine, and research and 
        their interconnections with industrial management, finance, and organization. I am also interested in mental health outreach and DEI work 
        for underrepresented communities in STEM and medicine. I am currently looking for opportunities in clinical engagement and to apply my interests 
        and experiences at a patient level. 

        Outside my academics and extracurriculars, I love to dance, play volleyball and other sports!</p>
